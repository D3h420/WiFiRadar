# WiFiRadar

## Overview
WiFiRadar is a simple WiFi scanning tool built for the ESP8266 microcontroller. It scans nearby WiFi networks, measures their signal strength, and converts it to an estimated distance in meters. Results are displayed on a 0.96" OLED screen or via serial monitor. 

## Features
- **Sniff**: Detects nearby 2.4GHz WiFi networks.
- **Screen output**: Displays SSID and estimated distance via serial monitor.

## Example Output
```
WiFiRadar Scan Results:
 HomeWiFi, Distance: ~2.5 m
 GuestNetwork, Distance: ~10.3 m
 CoffeeShop, Distance: ~15.7 m
```
